#### System Bus Radio | [Link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13642274/system_bus_radio/airgap.html)
System Bus Radio is a program that transmits radio on computer without radio transmitting hardware. It makes use of electromagnetic radiation emitted by certain instructions in order to send information over radio. I helped to port System Bus Radio over to a vanilla JavaScript PoC that works off your regular browser.
