I've had quite a bit of technical content that I wanted to share with the world, yet lacked a medium to do so. So, I took some time to start a personal blog where I can share some knowledge hopefully. :)

Some posts that will be coming soon are:

1. Write up for some of the challenges I wrote for the X-CTF qualifiers.
2. Write up for the three exploit I analyzed while interning at FireEye Singapore.
3. Write up for the malware that has been continuously sent to the NUS Greyhats email.
4. A more detailed post for the talk I gave during the NUS Hackers' Friday Hacks session.
